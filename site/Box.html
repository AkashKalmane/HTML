			Okay, so here are the four paragraph boxes that we had. Okay, so let's go ahead and float the very first paragraph box to the right. We'll say, float: right, and we'll go ahead and refresh the page, and you see that the box jumped all the way to the right, top edge of the containing element. Now, a couple of quick things to notice right away. First, is that you could see that the rest of them moved up as if the maroon box isn't there anymore. And the reason this is happening is because when you float elements, the browser takes them out of the regular document flow. And this is why the second paragraph box moves into the original spot of the first one, because as far as the regular document flow is concerned, that spot became empty. Second thing to notice is that even though each one of these paragraph boxes has a margin around them, as you can see that there's a margin between each one of them right here, that margin collapses as we've learned before when it is touching the margin of another element. However, when it comes to floated elements, the margins never collapse.
		</p>  -->
		<p id="p2">
			And what this is doing is telling the browser that the section element is announcing that nothing should be allowed to be floating to the left of it. And since every single paragraph that we've been floating is floating to the left, when we save it and refresh, this should jump right below here, and so it does. And this is not restricted to the non floated elements. We can ask a floated element to resume its regular document flow, and then float it again. So for example, the reason this box is situated right here is because there's something already floated to the left of it, but if I tell the browser to go ahead and resume the regular document flow on it, it should jump to the next line and then resume floating from there on. So that's box number three, so let's go ahead and go over here and say clear, and since things are floated to the left of the box, we're going to say clear: left, so nothing should be allowed to flow to the left of it.
